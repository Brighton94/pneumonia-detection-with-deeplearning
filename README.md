# pneumonia-detection-with-deeplearning

My goal is to get more familiar with PyTorch and to archive accuracies near 93% or better. The best value that I found in a research paper using convolutional neural networks is 92.31%. Click [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340961287_Pneumonia_Detection_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_CNNs) for the research paper. An additional goal is to do [transfer learning in PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html).
