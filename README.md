# pneumonia-detection-with-deeplearning
This is an ongoing deep learning project that I am doing to get more familiar with PyTorch.

My goal is to get more familiar with PyTorch and to archive accuracies near 93% or better. The best value that I found in a research paper using convolutional neural networks is 92.31%.
